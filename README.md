# React Chat
This is simple chat application made with React and Firebase to practise my front-end skills.

Project was created with vite. The easiest way to run it is to use codespace and run the following command. 
npm install (probably will run automatically)
npm run dev
# Features:
<ul>
  <li>Base Registration/Login system</li>
  <li>Friendlist</li>
  <li>Sending messages to selected friend</li>
  <li>Blocking user</li>
</ul>
Feel free to edit and use as base of your application.
